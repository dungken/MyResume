- **Coolxprint**: Custom apparel design service
- **Responsive Header/Footer**: Navigation and site information

## 3. Technologies Used

**Programming Language and Framework**:
- TypeScript as the primary programming language
- React.js (v18) as the main frontend framework

**State Management and Routing**:
- React Context API for local state management
- React Router (v6) for client-side routing
- Local Storage for persistent cart and user data

**UI Libraries and Components**:
- Bootstrap (v5) for responsive layout and components
- React Bootstrap for pre-built UI components
- React Slick for image carousels and product galleries
- RC Slider for range sliders in product filtering
- React Icons for UI iconography
- React Toastify for notifications

**Authentication and Security**:
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- Social login integration (Google, Facebook)

**Third-party Integrations**:
- Firebase for authentication and storage
- Axios for HTTP requests

**Styling**:
- CSS for component styling
- Responsive design with media queries

## 4. Project Structure and Architecture

The project follows a well-organized component-based architecture:

- **Component Structure**: Modular components organized by feature (Home, Product, Cart, etc.)
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Separate services for API interactions (AuthService, ProductService, etc.)
- **Model-Based Types**: TypeScript interfaces for data modeling
- **Utility Functions**: Reusable helpers for common operations

The architecture uses clear separation of concerns with:
- `/components` - UI components organized by feature
- `/services` - API and external service integrations
- `/utils` - Utility functions and helpers
- `/assets` - Static assets (images, CSS)
- `/models` - TypeScript interfaces/types

## 5. API Integration

The application integrates with a RESTful backend API through:

- **Axios** for HTTP requests with interceptors for authentication
- **JWT tokens** stored in localStorage for authenticated requests
- **Service-based API consumption**: 
  - AuthService for authentication endpoints
  - ProductService for product catalog and details
  - CartService for shopping cart operations
  - UserService for user profile management

The frontend communicates with backend services through these dedicated service modules, maintaining a clean separation between UI and data fetching logic.

## 6. Third-party Services Integration

The application integrates with several third-party services:

- **Firebase** for authentication and possibly file storage
- **Google OAuth** for social login functionality
- **Facebook Login** for social authentication

## 7. Authentication/Authorization

The authentication system offers multiple options:

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Token storage and authorization headers
- **Social Login**: Integration with Google and Facebook
- **Email Confirmation**: Account verification via email
- **Password Management**: Forgot/reset password functionality
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security option

## 8. UI/UX Libraries

The user interface is built with:

- **Bootstrap 5**: Primary CSS framework for responsive layout
- **React Bootstrap**: React components for Bootstrap
- **React Slick**: Carousel and slider components
- **RC Slider**: Range slider components for filtering
- **React Icons**: Icon library
- **React Toastify**: Toast notifications for user feedback

## 9. Notable Features and Best Practices

- **TypeScript Integration**: Type-safe code throughout the application
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout for all screen sizes
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Cart and user data preserved between sessions
- **Form Validation**: Input validation for forms
- **Service Pattern**: API calls abstracted into service modules
- **Color Conversion Utilities**: Hex to color name conversion for better UX
- **Internationalization Ready**: Currency formatting with Intl API
- **Modular CSS**: CSS organized by feature components
- **Lazy Loading Images**: Optimized image loading for performance
- **Interactive Product Selection**: Color and size selection with visual feedback
