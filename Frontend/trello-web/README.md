## 4. Project Structure and Architecture

The project follows a feature-based structure with clear separation of concerns:

- **/src/apis**: API integration code
- **/src/assets**: Static assets such as images
- **/src/components**: Reusable UI components organized by function
- **/src/customHooks**: Custom React hooks for shared functionality
- **/src/customLibraries**: Extended or customized libraries
- **/src/pages**: Main application pages organized by feature
- **/src/redux**: Redux store, slices, and state management
- **/src/utils**: Utility functions and constants

Key architectural patterns:
- **Feature-Based Organization**: Components grouped by feature domain
- **Component Composition**: Smaller, focused components combined for complex UI
- **Redux for Global State**: Centralized state management with slice pattern
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic abstracted into hooks

## 5. Drag-and-Drop Implementation

The drag-and-drop functionality is a highlight of this project, featuring:

- **Advanced Collision Detection**: Custom algorithm to determine card placement
- **Cross-Container Dragging**: Cards can be moved between columns
- **Touch and Mouse Support**: Custom sensors for mobile compatibility
- **Placeholder Elements**: Visual indicators for empty columns
- **Drop Animation**: Smooth transitions when dropping elements
- **Performance Optimizations**: Debounced functions and efficient re-renders

Implementation details:
- Using `DndContext` from @dnd-kit/core for drag-and-drop container
- Custom collision detection strategy for accurate card placement
- Optimized drag event handlers for column and card movement
- Real-time API updates on drag completion

## 6. Redux Implementation

State management is handled through Redux Toolkit with the following slices:

- **User Slice**: Authentication state and user information
- **Active Board Slice**: Current board details and state
- **Active Card Slice**: Selected card details for modal display
- **Notifications Slice**: User notifications and alerts

Key Redux features:
- **Redux Persist**: State persistence across browser refreshes
- **Thunk Actions**: Asynchronous API calls within Redux
- **Normalized State**: Optimized data structures for performance
- **Selectors**: Efficient state access and derived data

## 7. API Integration

The application integrates with a RESTful backend through:

- **Axios Instances**: Configured for authentication and base URL
- **API Function Modules**: Organized by domain (boards, cards, users)
- **JWT Authentication**: Token storage and authorization headers
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error management across requests

## 8. Real-time Features

Real-time functionality is implemented using Socket.io:

- **Live Board Updates**: Changes reflect instantly across users
- **Notifications**: Real-time alerts for board activities
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multiple users can work on the same board
- **Connection Management**: Handling connection states and reconnection

## 9. Responsive Design

The UI is fully responsive with:

- **Material UI Grid System**: Flexible layout components
- **Media Queries**: Display adjustments for different screen sizes
- **Touch-Optimized Interactions**: Mobile-friendly drag-and-drop
- **Adaptive Components**: UI elements that respond to screen size
