## 3. Technologies Used

**Programming Language and Framework**:
- TypeScript as the main programming language
- React.js (v18) as the frontend framework

**State Management and Routing**:
- React hooks for local state management
- React Router (v6) for client-side routing
- JWT for authentication state

**UI Libraries and Components**:
- Bootstrap (v5) for responsive layout and components
- React Bootstrap for pre-built UI components
- React Bootstrap Icons for iconography
- React Quill for rich text editing
- Custom CKEditor build for advanced content editing

**Authentication and Security**:
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- Role-based authorization with permission checks
- Protected routes for access control

**API Integration**:
- RESTful API consumption using the Fetch API
- Structured API service modules

## 4. Project Structure and Architecture

The project follows a well-organized component-based architecture:

- **Component Structure**: Modules organized by domain (user, theory, forum, etc.)
- **Service Layer Pattern**: API modules for backend communication
- **Type-Safe Development**: TypeScript interfaces for data modeling
- **Route Protection**: Access control based on user roles

The architecture uses clear separation of concerns with:
- `/src/api` - API service modules for data fetching
- `/src/layouts` - UI components organized by feature domain
- `/src/models` - TypeScript interfaces for data types
- `/src/utils` - Utility functions and reusable components

## 5. API Integration

The application integrates with a RESTful backend API through:

- **Fetch API** for HTTP requests with JWT token authentication
- **Type-safe responses** using TypeScript interfaces
- **Service-based API consumption**: 
  - UserAPI for user management
  - TheoryAPI for theoretical content
  - ThreadAPI for forum functionality
  - PostAPI for article management
  - RoleAPI and PermissionAPI for access control

## 6. Authentication/Authorization

The authentication system implements:

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Token storage and authorization headers
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, Staff, and User role levels
- **Permission Management**: Granular permissions for different actions
- **Protected Routes**: Components for ensuring authorized access
- **Email Verification**: Account activation via email
- **Password Recovery**: Secure password reset functionality

## 7. UI/UX Elements

The user interface leverages:

- **Bootstrap 5**: Responsive layout framework
- **React Bootstrap**: Component library
- **Rich Text Editors**: For content creation and editing
- **Pagination**: For managing large data sets
- **Search Functionality**: For content discovery
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout
- **Sidebar Navigation**: For intuitive section browsing

## 8. Notable Features and Best Practices

- **Component Reusability**: Modular design for maximum code reuse
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and messaging
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during data fetching
- **Route Protection**: Security based on user roles
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large data sets
- **Search Capabilities**: Content discovery across multiple domains
- **Rich Content Editing**: Advanced editors for content creation
- **Date and Time Formatting**: Consistent datetime display
