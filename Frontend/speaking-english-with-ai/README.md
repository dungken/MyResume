## 4. Project Structure and Architecture

The project follows a Clean Architecture approach with a feature-first organization:

**Core Layer**:
- `/core/constants`: Global constants
- `/core/di`: Dependency injection setup
- `/core/error`: Exception and failure handling
- `/core/network`: Network connectivity management
- `/core/presentation`: Shared UI components
- `/core/routes`: Navigation and routing
- `/core/services`: Global services (audio, etc.)
- `/core/theme`: App theming and styling
- `/core/usecases`: Base use case definitions
- `/core/utils`: Utility functions and helpers

**Feature Layer**:
Each feature module follows the same internal structure:
- `/features/[feature]/data`: Data sources, models, repositories
- `/features/[feature]/di`: Feature-specific dependency injection
- `/features/[feature]/domain`: Entities, repositories interfaces, use cases
- `/features/[feature]/presentation`: UI components, BLoC/state management

**Feature Modules**:
- `/features/authentication`: User authentication and account management
- `/features/conversations`: Core conversational functionality
- `/features/home`: Main dashboard and navigation hub
- `/features/image_description`: Visual language practice
- `/features/onboarding`: First-time user experience
- `/features/practice_mistakes`: Targeted language practice
- `/features/profile`: User profile management
- `/features/settings`: App configuration

## 5. API Integration

The application communicates with backend services through a robust API layer:

- **Repository Interfaces** define the contract between data and domain layers
- **Repository Implementations** handle data source selection and error mapping
- **Remote Data Sources** manage API calls and response parsing
