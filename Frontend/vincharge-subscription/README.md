- Error handling and validation messaging

## 4. Project Structure and Architecture

The project follows a well-organized structure with clear separation of concerns:

- **/lib/screens**: All application screens organized by feature
- **/lib/widgets**: Reusable UI components
- **/lib/models**: Data models and structures
- **/lib/providers**: State management providers
- **/lib/services**: API and service integration
- **/lib/utils**: Utility functions and constants

The architecture implements several key patterns:

- **Provider Pattern**: For state management across the application
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **Service Locator Pattern**: For dependency injection
- **Builder Pattern**: For complex UI construction

## 5. State Management

The application uses Provider for state management with several key providers:

- **AuthProvider**: Manages authentication state, user data, and JWT tokens
- **LanguageProvider**: Handles language selection and localization

State management features include:

- **Persistent State**: Saving and retrieving state across app restarts
- **Reactive UI**: Components that update based on state changes
- **Context Access**: Global state accessible throughout the application
- **Local State**: Component-specific state managed with StatefulWidget

## 6. Authentication Implementation

The authentication system is comprehensive, featuring:

- **JWT Token Authentication**: Secure token storage and management
- **Remember Me Functionality**: Persistent login across sessions
- **Password Recovery Flow**: Email-based reset with OTP verification
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Session Management**: Proper handling of login state

## 7. Multilingual Support

The application implements a robust localization system:

- **Language Toggle**: Easy switching between English and Vietnamese
- **Persistent Selection**: Language preference saved between sessions
- **Complete Translation**: All UI elements and messages available in both languages
- **Visual Indicators**: Flag icons for language selection

## 8. User Experience Considerations

Several features enhance the overall user experience:

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading indicators during async operations
- **Form Validation**: Immediate feedback on input errors
- **Optimized Workflows**: Minimal steps to complete common tasks
- **Consistent Design**: Uniform styling across all screens
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and recovery options

## 9. Best Practices Implemented

The project adheres to several development best practices:

- **Clean Code**: Well-organized, readable, and maintainable code
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between UI, business logic, and data access
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and user feedback
- **Reusable Components**: Abstraction of common UI elements
- **Input Validation**: Thorough validation of user inputs
- **Secure Authentication**: Proper credential and token management
- **Internationalization**: Complete multilingual support
- **Platform Integration**: Proper use of device capabilities
