# Trello API - Project Analysis

## Project Overview
The Trello API is a robust backend service that replicates and extends the core functionality of Trello, providing a RESTful API for task management with boards, columns, and cards. The application includes user authentication, real-time collaboration features, and comprehensive data management capabilities.

## Implemented APIs
The API is organized into several modules:

1. **Board Management**
   - Create, update, and retrieve boards
   - Board details with columns and cards
   - Board sharing and membership management
   - Advanced operations like moving cards between columns

2. **Card Management**
   - Create, update, delete, and organize cards
   - Card details and attachments
   - Card movement within and between columns

3. **Column Management**
   - Create, update, delete columns
   - Organize columns within boards
   - Column ordering and management

4. **User Management**
   - User registration and authentication
   - Profile management and updates
   - Role-based permissions

5. **Invitation System**
   - Invite users to boards
   - Real-time notification via sockets
   - Email notifications integration

## Technologies Used

### Programming Language & Runtime
- Node.js (18+)
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+) with Babel transpilation

### Framework & Core Libraries
- Express.js for API routing
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- MongoDB for database (using native driver)
- JWT for authentication

### Cloud Services
- Cloudinary for file/image storage
- Brevo (formerly SendinBlue) for email services
- MongoDB Atlas for database hosting

### Development Tools
- Babel for transpilation
- ESLint for code quality
- Nodemon for development
- Cross-env for environment management

### Security & Authentication
- JWT-based authentication flow with refresh tokens
- Password encryption with bcryptjs
- Cookie-based token storage
- CORS configuration

## Project Structure
The project follows a well-organized, modular architecture:

- **Controller Layer**: RESTful endpoint handlers
- **Service Layer**: Business logic implementation
- **Model Layer**: Data access and schema validation
- **Route Layer**: API endpoint definition and versioning
- **Middleware**: Authentication, error handling, and file uploads
- **Providers**: External service integrations
- **Validations**: Request data validation
- **Sockets**: Real-time event handling

## Database Implementation
- MongoDB with native driver
- Schema validation using Joi
- Relational data modeling in NoSQL context
- Complex aggregation pipelines
- Pagination and filtering implementation

## Authentication & Authorization
- JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Cookie-based token storage for security
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism
- Route protection with middleware

## Integrated Services
- Email notifications through Brevo API
- File storage and management with Cloudinary
- Socket.IO for real-time board updates and notifications

## Architecture Highlights
- Clean separation of concerns
- Versioned API structure (v1, v2)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Environment-based configuration
- Real-time data synchronization
- MVC-inspired architecture
- Graceful server shutdown with cleanup
